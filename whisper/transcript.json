  "text": "I used to rule the world, Seas would rise when I gave the word, Now in the morning I sleep alone, Sweep the streets I used to own. I used to roll the dice, Feel the fear in my enemies eyes, Listen as the crowd would sing, Now the old king's dead, long live the king. One minute I held the key, Next the walls were closed on me, And I discovered that my castle's down, Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand. I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing, Roman Catholic choirs a-singing, A beam of mirror my soul to shield, My missionaries in the front field. For some reason I can't explain, Once you'd gone there was never, Never an honest word, That was when I ruled the world. It was a wicked and wild wind, Blew down the doors to let me in, The shattered windows and the sound of drums, People couldn't believe what I'd become, Revolutionaries waiting, For my head on a silver plate, Just a puppet on a lonely string, All cruel whatever one of them came. I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing, Roman Catholic choirs a-singing, A beam of mirror my soul to shield, My missionaries in the front field. For some reason I can't explain, I know Saint Peter won't call my name, Never an honest word, But that was when I ruled the world. I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing, Roman Catholic choirs a-singing, A beam of mirror my soul to shield, My missionaries in the front field. For some reason I can't explain, I know Saint Peter won't call my name, Never an honest word, But that was when I ruled the world."
